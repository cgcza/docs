The Cape Gliding Club is non-profit and is operated by volunteers. Gliding is also very much weather dependent.  The below FAQ’s will help you to know what to expect. We kindly request our welcome visitors to be patient and exercise understanding with club members and officials should technical (or other) challenges delay or prevent us from offering you a prompt flight.

We look forward to seeing you at our club!

# What is a TIF?
A Training Introductory Flight (TIF) is basically your first Glider Flight lesson as an individual flight.
The fee includes temporary membership to the relevant organizations.

# Which days may I visit the Cape Gliding Club for a TIF?
CGC operates on weekends and South African public holidays all year around, with an exception being the period from mid-December to mid-January. 

# What are the best weather conditions for a TIF?
Gliders can fly safely in a variety of weather conditions, with the exception being rain and very high winds (60kph+). The weather in Worcester is often clear when it is raining in Cape Town. It is advisable to check the local Worcester forecast before "writing-off" a visit. Please note, however, that gliding is weather depended, so we cannot guarantee the duration of your flight or that there will be any flying on any particular day. 

# What time should I arrive at the airfield ... and then what?
Flying usually starts between 11h00 and 12h30. To avoid long wait times for your flight, it is advisable to arrive earlier, around 10h00, to put your name on the flying list. Flying is on a "first-come first-served" basis. Note that it is club policy for members to be given priority over visitors for their launches between the hours of 12h00 and 14h00. On arrival ask for the duty pilot. He/she will log your name and then tell you what to do next. Flying can continue until sunset. Visitors should count on spending the entire day at the airfield. We would love you to join the members in the clubhouse after flying for social activities.

# Do I need to sign anything?
Before commencing a TIF a visitor will need to sign an indemnity form. These forms are held by the duty pilot at the red-and-white start wagon. If the person is a minor, the signature of the legal guardian will be required. The stub from this form must be presented to the instructor before getting into the glider.

# What do I need to bring along?
A hat, closed shoes, sunscreen, and insect repellent (mostly for evenings).

# If I join the club and start instruction, will my TIF count towards my license?
Should you choose to join the club and have paid the required entry fees, your TIF will be seen as your first instructional flight. It will be entered in your gliding student log book. You will be charged at the reduced club member rates for this and all subsequent flights.

# Are there food and refreshments available at the airfield? 
The clubhouse has a bar for refreshments. Please ask a local pilot/member to assist you with getting and paying for refreshments from the bar. No food is available at the airfield, but can be obtained at Worcester restaurants, supermarkets and take-away outlets (a 5-10 minute drive from the airfield). During the day visitors may sit in the air conditioned clubhouse.

# What if my aero-tow flight is less than 30 minutes – do I get a discount or partial refund?
30 Minutes is the maximum flight time. Actual flight time is dependent on the weather conditions and it may be less. No refunds or discounts are applicable.
Will we do aerobatics during the flight?
Only certain instructors will do aerobatics. You should not expect aerobatics as part of your TIF, but if this is something you would like, then we suggest you discuss it with the duty pilot on the day you arrive to see if a pilot happy to fly aerobatics is available.

# Can I take pictures during the flight?
Yes, this is possible. It is however best to take only a small camera that can be secured in a pocket should you encounter turbulence during the flight. 

# What if the wind or the thermals stop?
Gliders can fly in low (zero) and high wind conditions. They stay aloft through the use of thermals or using the updrafts on the windward side of mountain ridges. When lift is no longer available, the pilot simply returns to the airfield.

# What if it rains or a gale starts blowing?
We will not fly if the weather is unsafe. If already airborne, the pilot will return to the airfield should such conditions occur.

# Can I get involved in airfield activities while I’m there?
If you are so inclined, we welcome the assistance from visitors with pushing gliders etc and putting them away after flying. It’s fun and you’ll learn a lot!

# Is there a minimum or maximum weight to be able to fly? 
Maximum allowable pilot weight is 100kg. Passengers who are physically very large may have difficulty fitting into the glider. Lighter passengers can be accommodated using ballast weights, but very light passengers may need to sit in the back seat rather than the front seat. Passengers (especially children) must be large enough to wear the seat belts in the correct, safe manner.
